## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement proper CSRF protection

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use secure session management
   - Implement proper JWT handling
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)

3. **Data Protection**
