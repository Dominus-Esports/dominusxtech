export class AgentManager extends EventEmitter {
  // Loose coupling between components
  // Real-time updates via WebSocket
  // Scalable event handling
}
```

### **Separation of Concerns**

deploy-staging:
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  environment: staging

# Production Deployment (main branch)
deploy-production:
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  environment: production
```
